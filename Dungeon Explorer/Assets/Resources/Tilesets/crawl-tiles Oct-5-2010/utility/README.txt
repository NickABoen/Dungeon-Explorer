This directory contains some of the scripts and text files I used to determine which tiles from Crawl Stone Soup were relicensed.

licenseFinder.py - A hacky script that prints out every changelist that touched any file in the rltiles directory in crawl. Will need modifications to run.

Raw List.txt - A raw output of licenseFinder, with changes of obvious unimportances (build fixes, etc) removed.

Filtered List.txt - A sorted list of people and changes. It has been seperated by those who have signed off, and those whos tiles have not been and thus removed from this export.

Deleted List.txt - A list of those tiles which exist in Crawl Stone Soup that are not under the CC zero license and are therefor not distributable under this export.
